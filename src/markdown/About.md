Data.gov.au provides an easy way to find, access and reuse public data. Our team works across governments to publish data and continue to improve functionality based on user feedback. We encourage you to use government data to analyse, mashup and develop tools and applications to benefit all Australians.

Geospatial datasets on data.gov.au and from other spatial indexes are now available through the [National Map](http://www.nationalmap.gov.au/).

We’re keen to hear how you’re using public data. Information on submitting your [public data use cases can be found in the Open Data Toolkit](https://toolkit.data.gov.au/index.php?title=Using_Data#Use_Cases). If you’re an Australian Government entity and want to share your experience with public data via our public data blog, [please get in touch with us](mailto:data@pmc.gov.au).

In addition to open datasets, data.gov.au now includes information about unpublished data and data available for purchase.

The [about page](http://data.gov.au/about) has information about the service including the background, support, terms of use, privacy statement and other information.
